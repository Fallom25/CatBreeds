# Cat Breeds APP

## Project Description
This Project is a Cat Breeds APP. Allowing Users to view information about cat breeds, searching Breeds and favoring them.

## How to Install and Run
I have chosen to use Npm and Node.js as my command line utility. 

**Installing**
- Cloning the repo
- Having Npm and Node.js install on your machine
- Running *npm install* in the command line 

**Run**
- Once npm install has finished running
- Using the *npm start* command will host the project locally


## How to use
### Home
Can view all available Cat breeds

### Search
Can search cat breeds by name in the search bar. This will filter breeds as you search.

## Favourites
By clicking the heart you are adding your favourite breeds to the local storage favourites list. Which can be viewed by clicking on the Fav Breeds button.

## Outline of my Solution
This App was made using the ReactJS framework. All components were styled using Css and the preprocessor Sass. 

## Considerations and Further Growth
Testing 
Better component design maybe using a Component library and pictures.
Adding Cookies to the favourites instead of local storage.
